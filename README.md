# ProdCast
Welcome to the ProdCast project. The goal of this is to make from the ground up, a software that helps making podcasts.

At the end, the goal would be that every participant to the podcast could connect to a host and the host controls the clients. Audio recording and playback, audio mixing, VST support will be supported. (if i finish this project xdd)
