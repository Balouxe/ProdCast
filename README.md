# ProdCast
Welcome to the ProdCast engine, audio engine focused primarly on DAWs/Audio Softwares; however will probably support stuff for games as well.
This is a personal project that I'm doing in my free time so the development is slow.

For now it can just load mutiple wav, mp3 or flac files into memory, play them back at the simultaneously, change their volume and panning, and add effects to them.

I want it to be able to :
- Support a wide variety of file formats
- Support VSTs
- Stuff I suppose
