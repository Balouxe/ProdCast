# ProdCast
Welcome to the ProdCast engine, audio engine focused primarly on DAWs/Audio Softwares; however will probably support stuff for games as well.
This is a personal project that I'm doing in my free time so the development is slow.
For now it can just load a wav file into memory, play it back, change the volume and the panning.

I want it to be able to :
- Support a wide variety of file formats
- Support VSTs
- Stuff I suppose
